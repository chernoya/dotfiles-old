# my dotfiles (old)

The rice is centered around the decay colorscheme, so check that out [here](https://github.com/decaycs)
### Warning! 
This is my first rice so some stuff _might_ be broken, also everything is tailored to my tastes so please thoroughly look at what you're adding into your config 

## Installation
### Step 1: Prerequisites
> i3-gaps

> polybar

> picom-jonaburg

> rofi

> zathura

> firefox

> cava

> fish (with tide prompt)

> Spotify (with spicetify, sleek bladerunner theme)

### Step 2: Follow the instructions

I didn't make an install script, so just clone this repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/sceinja/i3-dotfiles.git
```
After you've cloned the repo, move the files into your **/home/.config** directory and restart your window manager _(SUPER+shift+e)_
(Look up your SUPER key if you don't know what it is). 

It all should work now. But if there is some problem and it isn't working for you or you want to ask a question, shoot me a dm on dicord at **scja#4767**
